# React Projects with Vite

This repository contains a collection of React projects using Vite. Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience than traditional tools like Webpack.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can then install Vite by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g vite


Once you have Vite installed, you can clone this repository and create a new project for each project you want to work on. For example, to create a new project for the "to-do list" project, you would run the following command:

bash
vite@latest create-react-app to-do-list


This will create a new directory called `to-do-list` and install all of the dependencies for the project. You can then start the development server by running the following command:

bash
cd to-do-list
npm run dev


This will open the project in your browser and start the development server. You can then make changes to the code and see the results reflected in the browser.

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository has the following structure:


src
├── App.js
├── components
│   ├── TodoItem.js
│   └── TodoList.js
├── styles
│   └── index.css
├── index.html
└── package.json


The `App.js` file is the main entry point for the application. The `components` directory contains all of the React components used in the application. The `styles` directory contains all of the CSS styles used in the application. The `index.html` file is the main HTML file for the application. The `package.json` file contains all of the dependencies for the application.

## Vite Configuration

Vite is configured using a `vite.config.js` file. This file contains all of the configuration options for Vite, such as the project root directory, the output directory, and the list of plugins to use.

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Vite supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which allows you to see changes to your code reflected in the browser without having to reload the page. This can make development much faster and more efficient.

## Deployment

Once you have finished developing your project, you can deploy it to a web server. Vite can generate a production build of your project by running the following command:

bash
npm run build


This will create a `build` directory containing all of the files needed to deploy your project. You can then deploy the files to a web server.
